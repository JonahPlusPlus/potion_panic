# Potion Panic!

A little platformer for Bevy Game Jam #3.

## Building

On desktop, it is as simple as calling `cargo run`.

For web, default features need to be turned off and the "browser" feature needs to be enabled.

Then, it's a matter of using `wasm-bindgen` to generate files to the `out` directory.
